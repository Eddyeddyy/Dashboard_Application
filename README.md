# Dashboard_Application

This program demonstrate the creation of a web-based application using the Dash framework. I used a MongoDB database to store documents and created a python code to
use the CRUD functions for the application. Creating code that is maintanable, readable, and adaptable is essential, especially when working in a group setting. The way 
to create code this way is to make sure to create variables and functions with clear names that will indicate their function and comment throughout your code. Doing so
will aid others, including yourself, in reading your code and make adapting the code to other projects smoother and more reliable. As a computer Scientist I approach
problems by first analyzing all that is known and using that knowledge to craft ideas for a solution. In this project for example, the company Grazioso Salvare had a 
database of many different shelter animals, and Grazioso Salvare wanted an application created that can filter through the database and display certain animal types for
rescue. I worked in steps by first analyzing the database and how the files were formatted. Then I created the python code that would allow me to read the files and 
import them to the dash framework. Once I knew the files could be imported, I used the dash framework to organize the files in a nice readable DataTable, with filtering
options based on what Grazioso Salvare requested. We computer Scientest create solutions to problems people may have. We create software and programs that will aid many 
people with problems they may have, or simply make some tasks easier than they should. Like with Grazioso Salvare, they could easily go through the MongoDB database and 
find the files with the criteria they choose, but to be honest that can take a while. Creating this application allows them to quickly and easily view all the files of 
their choosing and make their decision from there.
